This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Idea

The project represents a very simple platform for sharing stories about travel, trips or other activities. Every user can register and log in to the platform and share their opinion about what's going on. Users have their own profile and can edit it whenever they want.

## Public part

**Non-Authorized user**
* Can see the application start page.
* Has access to register page.
* Has access to login page.

## Private part

**Authorized user**
* Can post about his adventures.
* Has access to his Profile page.
* Can do changes to his profile information.

## Structure

* Home
* Post
* Profile
* Login
* Register
* Logout

## Back-End
* NodeJS server is located in REST API folder


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

To start the server navigate to REST API folder and run: 

### `nodemon`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
